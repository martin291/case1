					<p>Hello and welcome to my page. I'm Martin!</p>
					<p> I'm from Dublin, Ireland. I'm in my first year at DCU, studying Computer Applications. 
					I'm enjoying the course and have made quite a few new friends. 
				 I don't have that much prior experience with HTML and CSS however, I feel I am getting the hang of it very quickly. 
					<br/> <br/>
					When I'm not doing college work I like to spend my time listening to music, watching movies, playing video games and chatting to friends over Discord. 
					I don't play sports but I try to stay fit and healthy. 
					I go on walks often and I like learning new recipes to cook or bake.
					I also enjoy art but I wouldn't say I'm very good at it.
					I sometimes follow Bob Ross tutorials or draw portraits of people.
					<br/><br/>
                    I am enjoying college but I miss my secondary school. TY was a very fun year. I went on school trips to Germany and the West of Ireland. I enjoyed the weeks of work experience I got in TY.</p>

                <p>During TY I spent weeks working in a few different places:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><p> I worked for a week at <a href="http://nearfm.ie/">NearFM Radio Station</a>.
				I sat in with the radio presenters and observed them work. Each day a different volunteer would have a show prepared. 
				I learnt what each button and switch on the control panel did. For example:
				    <ol><li> How to fade in out of a song</li><li> How to play a song from a CD or through Spotify </li> <li>How to take live calls</li></ol></li>
				<br/>
				<li> <p>I worked for two weeks at the <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/31ca36-heritage-services-state-art-collection/#">Office of Public Works State Art Collection</a> 
				. I spent that time going to several Art exhibitions, organising folders and unboxing paintings and transporting art pieces.</li>
				<li><p> I spent half a week at <a href= "https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/company-facts/ericsson-worldwide/ireland">Ericcson</a> learning Scratch and some basic Python with my peers. We worked in groups of four, designing a game in scratch.</p></li>
				<li> <p> I worked at <a href= "http://www.pcmoore.ie/">PC Moore & Company Solicitors</a> for about a week. I spent most of the time reading books on law or answering phone calls. However, on the second last day I was brought to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Courts">Four Courts</a>
				to be shown around. We spent the entire day taking the Luas around town. </p> </li>
				</ul>
