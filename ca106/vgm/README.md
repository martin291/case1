This is my section of the CA106 final group project. Our group had to create a news site with a home page and different news topics for each member of the group. Our site was called Video Game News and focused on several topics such as Triple A games, Indie Games and New Game Technology. My part was on music in video games. I created several articles on the topic using HTML and CSS.
