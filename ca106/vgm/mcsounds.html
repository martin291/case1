 <h2>The Evolution of Minecraft’s Sounds</h2>
 
 <p>Visually, people have an impression of what <a href="../indie/minecraft.html">Minecraft</a> looks like, but I believe that Minecraft also has a unique expression musically.</p>

 <p>Like many indie games, the original composer - Daniel Rosenfield (C418) - for Minecraft was given complete creative freedom. 
	Instead of the classic 8-bit chiptune style connected with video games, C418 opted for a more organic sound which would be partly electronic and partly acoustic. 
	C418 experimented with his piano recordings to create this desired mix.</p>
	
	 <div class="audio">
	 <p> Dry Hands:</p>
     <audio src="audio/dry-hands.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio>
	 </div>
	
 <p>As the game grew in popularity C418 revisited tracks to create a more cohesive work which could be sold as an album.
	Minecraft loops through its soundtrack randomly so C418 tested tracks together to see what order would work best for <br/> an album.</p>
	
	
 <p>The majority of Minecraft’s soundtrack is designed to be peaceful background music for the player. 
	Players can find or collect rare record discs to play in-game or even create their own music using note blocks which resonate a note when interacted with.</p>

 <p>Earlier this year the developers released the Nether Update.

 </div>
 This update added new mobs, biomes and music to Minecraft’s underworld inspired dimension.</p>

 
 <p>Since about Update Aquatic, released in 2018, a number of musicians, composers and sound designers have worked on Minecraft and its “spin-off” games.
	The new Nether, with its refreshed block sounds and new ambience indicates more sonical updates to come.</p>
  
 <p></br></br></br>The composers behind the Nether update challenged themselves to push the sound of the piano until it resembled other things entirely, to evoke an otherworldly feeling in players. 
 The composers achieve tight feelings of claustrophobia and despair with intimate piano solos. 
 This sound grows farther and farther away until it encompasses a huge cavern which makes the player feel overwhelmed by space. 
 This creates an impressive variety for the atmosphere of the Nether. 
 The Nether’s music does not only loop randomly but changes as the player traverses the biomes of the dimension, giving them a more distinct feeling. </p>

 <p>Minecraft’s now iconic soundtrack is designed to sink into the background and immerse the player in the world of the game. 
    There’s no doubt that this game's strange body of music will continue to grow in future updates.</p>
