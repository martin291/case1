		<h2>Pikmin’s Impressive Dynamic Soundtrack</h2>
		
		<p>The first Pikmin game was released by Nintendo in 2001. 
		It was developed by a team led by Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of some of the most acclaimed video game franchises of all time such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda. 
		Pikmin is an open-world strategy and puzzle game with an impressive dynamic soundtrack, composed by Hajime Wakai. But why is it so good?</p>
		
		<p>A dynamic soundtrack is one where the music changes in some way in reaction to what is happening in-game. 
		Examples of this are how the music changes when you obtain a star in a Mario game or how the music speeds up as enemies move closer in Space Invaders. </p>

		<p>In Pikmin, each tune on a soundtrack has multiple versions running simultaneously with the situation in the game dictating which version or versions will be heard by the player at any given time. </p>

		<p>The player’s exploration is separated into days. 
		Each day has a time limit which the player must work within. 
		As the day winds down so does the music. Over time the theme of the level fades into the sunset version of that theme. </p>
		
		<p>When a player encounters an enemy the music may change slightly to evoke a feeling of urgency which can act as a warning signal for the player. 
			If a player decides to confront the enemy the tracks bright sounds from string instruments and a glockenspiel or xylophone are accompanied by a percussion section. 
			This raises the stakes musically. </p>
			
		<p>In Pikmin 2 and Pikmin 3 the music shifts when the players Pikmin perform a task. 
		Pikmin’s base music is very open and ambient.
		The game’s music usually consists of one instrument leading the tune with other instruments fading in and out. 
		However, when the player orders the Pikmin to do something other instruments may join the song.
		These instruments leave hints of busyness and unity while still feeling unique to the level. </p>

		<p>Dynamic soundtracks can be created by having themes that have no discernible beat or rhythm underneath.
		The harmonies in these themes create the mood of the level. 
		Thick tones and layering of sounds help keep the tune from sounding empty. 
		The dreamy feeling of some of these themes contrast with the sudden change in the theme, creating a new context. </p>

		</div>
		
		<p>Other methods for dynamic soundtracks are to leave lots of space so new instruments won't clutter up the music or by creating tunes with odd musical arrangements which are perplexing until another instrument, such as a bass, joins to make the harmony feel complete.</p>
		
		
		<p>Despite being a relatively unpopular game compared to Miyamoto’s other works, the Pikmin Series’ brings a fresh musical breeze which should not be overlooked.</p>
