	<h2>What Makes a Great Main Theme?</h2>
	
	<p>What makes a video game’s music memorable. What keeps a game’s theme in your head for years?</p> 

	<p>In the early days, video game themes were simple 8-bit melodies that expressed musically the story, gameplay or mood of the game.
	A game's main theme must give a general sense of what the game is about and make players excited for the adventure. 
	For example, the first Metal Gear game’s theme was designed to show that it was a game of espionage and stealth.
	Meanwhile Sonic’s theme has a fast tempo, which mirrors the character’s speed and personality. </p>
	
	<p>As technology improved, composers took these iconic themes and fleshed them out by adding more instrumentation, while keeping the core melodies simple. 
	Many composers use the trick of leaping up through octaves to add weight and drama to even the most basic melodies.</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>The Legend of Zelda’s theme has evolved from a looping chiptune to an orchestral theme that feels different in every new entry in the series. 
	In the latest entry, Breath of the Wild, the theme is almost unrecognisable and evokes a feeling of exploration which suits the open-world style game.</p>

<br/>
	<p>Video games continue to have simple melodies in the centre of their main themes. 
	Halo’s theme involves a male choir which sings a simple melody before being accompanied by a percussion section and then dramatic strings. 
	This piece works to get the player excited. </p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<div class="audio">
	 <p> Halo:</p>
     <audio src="audio/halo.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio>
	 <p> Earthbound (Onett):</p>
	 <audio src="audio/earthbound.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element</audio>
		</div>
		
		
		
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


	 
	<p>One technique is to use the opening intervals of a theme - with wide spaces between notes - to draw in a listener's attention.
	The theme can then continue into a dramatic tune like in Halo or Skyrim, or it can be intimate like in Earthbound or UNDERTALE.
	Whatever the case, these themes become iconic.</p>

	<p>The music in the mario series is always fun and colourful, emulating the games style and gameplay. 
	The first track heard in the series starts with an attention grabbing hook before it kicks into gear.
	Mario’s music has never been bland. </p>

	<div class="audio">
	 <p> Super Mario Bros:</p>
     <audio src="audio/mario-bros.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio>
	 </div>
	 
<br/>
<br/>
	<p>Mario's music has always been a fantastic mix of jolly bright tones and darker tones which keep the soundtrack musically interesting.
	Putting emphasis on the offbeats makes the music bounce, a technique taken from jazz musicians. </p>
	
	 
	<br/> 
	
	<p>While this article does not answer the question of what exactly makes a great main theme for a video game,
	I hope it explains some of the reasons behind the nostalgic themes we find ourselves humming along to. </p>
