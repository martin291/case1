	<h2>Video Game Music: </br> Brief Explanation of a New Art Form</h2>
     <div class="intro">
	 <p>
	 Video games of the last 40 years have opened up new possibilities for what music can do - from early 8-bit chiptunes to complete orchestral soundtracks and even music that composes itself around how you play. 
	 But how did we get to this point?
     </p>
	 <div>
	 
	 <p>
	 Early video game music was limited to simple melodies using sound synthesizer technology. 
	 This inspired the style of music known as chiptunes, which combined the simple melodic styles with more complex patterns and traditional music styles.
	 This became the most popular sound of the first video games.
	 </p>
	 
	 <div class="audio"> <!-- STYLING FOR AUDIOFILES WAS VERY LIMITED SO I CREATED A DIV THAT WOULD HOLD THE TITLE AND AUDIOFILE INSIDE IT -->
	 <p> Example of how early chiptunes sounded:</p>
     <audio src="audio/chiptune.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio>
	 </div>
	 
	 <p>
	 In the late 1970’s, music was stored on physical mediums such as compact cassettes or records. 
	 Such components were expensive and broke easily under heavy use which made them poor for use in arcade machines.
	 A more affordable method was to use digital means. 
	 A specific computer chip would change electrical impulses from computer code into analog wave sounds, outputted through a speaker.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 The first game to use a continuous background soundtrack was Space Invaders, released by Taito in 1978. 
	 The soundtrack was dynamic and interacted with the player, increasing pace as enemies moved closer to the player.

	 <p>
	 Manami Matsumae and Yoko Shimamura defined the sound of video games through their work for Capcom in the 1980s and 1990s.
	 On The NES every note had to be laboriously programmed on just three channels.
	 Despite the limitations of that time, these composers created music that made chiptune sound like a new medium - Like Manami’s score for Mega Man and Yoko’s for Street Fighter II.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Manami says she was inspired by the music of Bach. 
	 In the 1990s, consoles grew in power to allow for iconic symphonic soundtracks for games like the Final Fantasy series. 
	 By the 21st century consoles could accommodate samples and recordings of orchestral instruments so that video game composers could create even more ambitious scores.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 An example is the score for Everybody’s Gone to Rapture, in which no two players experience the same music. 
	 Music is cued to player’s decisions in game, as well as being generated by itself. The player’s actions determine the sounds they hear. 
	 The player becomes the composer.
