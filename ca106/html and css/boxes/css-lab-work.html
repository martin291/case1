CSS Tutorial: differences between CSS and HTML
Let’s start with an example which will illustrate the difference between CSS and HTML.
Imagine that you’re building a house. What’s the first thing that comes to your mind? Is it the
colour of your walls and how you would decorate them? Is it the shape of the dining table
and the fabric of your sofa? Most people tend to think about the decorative aspects first
when they’re creating something. In the context of building a house, we call this interior
design. However, there’s another crucial element that we tend to take for granted. It’s the
structure that keeps everything from crumbling – the architecture of the house.
